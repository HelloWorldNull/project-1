<ol>Backstabbing
<li>Use your cloak to get behind the enemy, but uncloak behind walls or structures to muffle the uncloak sound.</li>
<li> Uncloak while disguised without being seen so if anyone sees you while you are on your way to get a backstab, no one calls you out. </li>
<li> Do. Not. Uncloak. Near an enemy or Sentry while undisguised, they will shoot you instantly. </li>
</ol>
<ul>Review
<li>Cloak helps to get behind the enemy, muffle the noise.</li>
<li>Keep a disguise on while cloaked so you always appear as an enemy. </li>
<li> Be careful of where you uncloak and be aware if you have a disguise on or not.</li>
<ol>"Spahs sappin mah sentry!"
<li>You an kill an engineer before you sap their sentry.</li>
<li>If you kill an engie before sapping, BE. QUICK. As soon as you are undisguised, the sentry will be trying to kill you.</li>
<li>Keep in mind that you have the lowest health in the game (along with Scout) especially if you are using the Kunai.</li>
